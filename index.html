        Hi! I'm a graduate student at the University of Florida studying galaxy formation & evolution with cosmological simulations. I love studying the high redshift Universe and the first chemically enriched galaxies formed at cosmic dawn. I am also interested in the ways we infer information about galaxies via SED modeling! I work with Desika Narayanan at UF as well as a long list of amazing scientists from institutions around the world.
