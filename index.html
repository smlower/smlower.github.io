        Hi! I'm a software developer at Guidehouse working with the Statistical Modeling Division of the National Weather Service's Meteorological Development Lab. I am a recent astronomy PhD graduate from the University of Florida, where I studied galaxy formation & evolution with cosmological simulations, led by my advisor Desika Narayanan in collaboration with a long list of amazing scientists from institutions around the world.
