<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Research Experience</span></strong>
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Advanced Modeling and Data Visualization: </strong>Developed a suite of massively-parallel fluid dynamics simulations (Cosmic Sands), improving upon previous resolution limits and model parameterizations. Science results include understanding the formation of the first dusty, massive galaxies in the Universe. Results published: Lower et al. 2023</li>

<li><strong>Astro-Focused Machine Learning: </strong>Co-developed an open source machine learning method (Mirkwood) to improve upon traditional spectral fitting algorithms, outperforming community standard codes by 50%. Science results include an enhanced ability to measure galaxy physical properties. Results published: Gilda, Lower, & Narayanan, 2021</li>

<li><strong>Benchmarking Community Modeling Techniques: </strong>Performed 3D ray tracing simulations to generate galaxy spectra and used Bayesian inference to determine the efficacy of models commonly used in the galactic astronomy community. Science results include understanding the impact of model parameterizations on inferred galaxy properties. Results published: Lower et al. 2020, Lower et al. 2022</li>
