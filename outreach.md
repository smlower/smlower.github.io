<p style="font-size: 18px;">

I've been incredibly lucky to have been a mentor as part of three programs, enabling more and more students to learn the joys of science and get exciting hands-on expereince with cutting edge research. Mentorship has allowed me to connect with incredible students and fantastic scientist in several collaborations; without previous experience as a mentee myself, I wouldn't have been able to pursue the path I'm currently on in my career as a scientist. Below you can find out more about these mentorship opportunties!

The <a href="https://www.dawnires.com/what-we-do">DAWN-IRES scholars program</a> invites advanced undergraduates to be mentored by researchers at the Cosmic Dawn Center of Excellence in Copenhagen, Denmark and by graduate students from around the globe. As a graduate research <a href="https://www.dawnires.com/scholarsblog/meet-the-dawn-ires-scholars-sidney-lower">mentor</a> in the 2021 cohort, I created and co-led professional development seminars and weekly research check-ins with the undergrad researchers. </p>
